# LULC & ChangeDetection for Bangalore for 2014 & 2020

## Overview

This project utilizes Google Earth Engine and Landsat-8 satellite data for Land Use Land Cover (LULC) analysis and Change Detection.

## Folders Structure

- **2014_lulc**: Contains code for 2014 LULC analysis.
- **2016_lulc**: Contains code for 2016 LULC analysis.
- **2020_lulc**: Contains code for 2020 LULC analysis.

## Instructions

1. Choose the appropriate year's folder (e.g., 2014_lulc).
2. Open `code.txt` inside the folder.
3. Copy the JavaScript code from `code.txt`.

## Running the Code

1. Open Google Earth Engine's script area.
2. Paste the copied code into the script area.
3. Run the script to generate the output.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Locate the Code File:

   - Navigate to the project folder.
   - Choose the folder corresponding to the desired year (e.g., 2014_lulc).

### 2. Open `code.txt`:

   - Inside the selected folder, you'll find a file named `code.txt`.
   - Open this file using a text editor.

### 3. Copy the JavaScript Code:

   - Select all the code within `code.txt`.
   - Copy the code to your clipboard.

### 4. Open Google Earth Engine:

   - Visit the Google Earth Engine platform in your web browser.
   - Ensure you are logged in with your Google account.

### 5. Access the Script Area:

   - On the left panel, click on the "Script" tab to access the script area.

### 6. Paste the Copied Code:

   - Inside the script area, paste the copied JavaScript code.
   - Review the code for any specific parameters that may need customization.

### 7. Run the Script:

   - Click on the "Run" button within the script area.
   - This will execute the code in the Google Earth Engine environment.

### 8. Monitor the Console:

   - Keep an eye on the console for any errors or progress messages.
   - The console will display information about the script execution.

### 9. Wait for Output:

   - Depending on the complexity of the analysis, the script may take some time to run.
   - Wait patiently for the process to complete.

### 10. View the Output:

   - Once the script finishes running, you can visualize the output directly in Google Earth Engine.
   - Explore the layers and maps generated by the script to observe the Land Use Land Cover analysis or change detection results.

Remember to follow Google Earth Engine's documentation and guidelines for a smooth execution of scripts and troubleshooting if needed.
